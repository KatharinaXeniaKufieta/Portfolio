# Portfolio

In this project I have created a portfolio that shows off my projects. It is fully responsive.

You can view the Portfolio at: http://kkufieta.github.io/portfolio

## Dependencies
### CSS Framework
I used a stripped down version of Bootstrap, because I wanted to define the style as much as possible myself.

## Download
Simply clone the game with

`git clone https://github.com/kkufieta/portfolio.git`

or [download it here](https://github.com/kkufieta/portfolio/archive/gh-pages.zip).

## Author
The code is written by [Katharina Kufieta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katharinakufieta).
