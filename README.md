# Portfolio

In this project I have created a portfolio that shows off my projects. It is fully responsive. I have created this portfolio before I learned about web performance, and have managed to built in seven CSS files. There is no way I can change the style easily without breaking the entire project. 

## CSS Framework
I used a stripped down version of Bootstrap, because I wanted to define the style as much as possible myself (7 CSS files!). These days I would choose a beautiful CSS framework rather than defining all the details myself, but this was definitely a fun exercise.
